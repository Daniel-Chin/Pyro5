.. index:: what is Pyro

What is Pyro?
-------------
It is a library that enables you to build applications in which
objects can talk to each other over the network, with minimal programming effort.
You can just use normal Python method calls to call objects on other machines.
Pyro is a pure Python library and runs on many different platforms and Python versions.

Pyro can be found on Pypi as `Pyro5 <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pyro5/>`_.  Source on Github: https://github.com/irmen/Pyro5

**Pyro5 is still in beta status and it is likely to receive a few changes still in the near future.**
